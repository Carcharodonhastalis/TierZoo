# TierZoo: The Website

Hey there, this is a half-built website for the fantastic YouTube series [TierZoo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsRtomD4twRf5WVHHk-cMw).

It aims to emulate the look and feel of the video, uh, slides(?) and allow for all the kinds of data in the video to be easily accessible.

## What needs to be done?

Glad you asked. I made a checklist.

- [x] Display builds(animals) in a tier list.
- [x] Display subgroups of builds in the same tier list.
- [x] Make pages for individual builds.
- [x] Display a build's abilities on its build page.
- [ ] Allow video embeds on build pages (y'know, for the actual TierZoo video)
- [ ] Style build pages to show all the info nicely.
- [ ] Skill trees. Just anything on them in general.
- [ ] Allow for sorting by nerdy things like kingdom and phylum.
- [ ] ...And much more! That I haven't thought of yet!
