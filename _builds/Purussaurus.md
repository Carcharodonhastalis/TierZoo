Weighing in at 8.4 tonnes, the Purussaurus is the 
king of all crocodiles across all expansions.

Any players who dared to challenge this monstrosity 
had to back it up unthinkable size and power lest they be
bodied by the sheer power the Purussaurus build wields.

Purussaurus turns the crocodile stereotype up to 11- 
it's a slow but powerful build on land, but in water 
it becomes a nightmarish torpedo of death and destruction.
